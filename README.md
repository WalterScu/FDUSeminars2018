# Motives Summer seminar

A seminar for about one-month will be hold in SCMS, 2018. We will talk about constructions of geometric motives such that Chow motives and the machinery techniques used in the constructions. K-theory, motivic homotopy theory and motivic cohomology theory will also be discussed. The seminar is intended to provide some algebraic topology flavor for working algebraic geometers which is more and more important language in modern algebraic geometry.
